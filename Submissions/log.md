<h5>Day 1- 7</h5><br>
Task Review:Throughout the first week,I have completed all the seven task but my hardest task was the day 3 task that required us to commit our work to Github.I honestly don't know much about Github ,I was lucky to find someone willing to help me.Now my saturdays are dedicated to understanding how github works.
Lessons:Team work is the dream work.
