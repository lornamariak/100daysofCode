<h4>100 Days of Code :The weekly Twists,Turns & Highlights</h4><br>
<h5>Day 1- 7</h5><br>
<p>Task Review:Throughout the first week,I have completed all the seven task but my hardest task was the day 3 task that required us to commit our work to Github.I honestly don't know much about Github ,I was lucky to find someone willing to help me.Now my saturdays are dedicated to understanding how github works.</p><br>
<p>Lessons:Team work is the dream work.</p>
<h5>Day 8 - 15</h5> <br>
<p> Task Review: After week one, I feel i have survived the hardest part.Week two is here and I am so energyized.Throughout week two I have learned the value of commitment.I almost gave up because of some unrelated personal problems.But the wil to continue comes from an undivided place.</p>
<p> Lessons: Go an extra mile,it reflects on your results.</p>
<p>Plus One: I built my first portfolio on code pen <a href="https://codepen.io/twenties/full/MExJMY/">Here</a></p>
