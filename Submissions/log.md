<h4>100 Days of Code :The weekly Twists,Turns & Highlights</h4><br>
<h5>Day 1- 7</h5><br>
<p>Task Review:Throughout the first week,I have completed all the seven task but my hardest task was the day 3 task that required us to commit our work to Github.I honestly don't know much about Github ,I was lucky to find someone willing to help me.Now my saturdays are dedicated to understanding how github works.</p><br>
<p>Lessons:Team work is the dream work.</p>
<h5>Day 8 - 15</h5> <br>
<p> Task Review: After week one, I feel i have survived the hardest part.Week two is here and I am so energyized.Throughout week two I have learned the value of commitment.I almost gave up because of some unrelated personal problems.But the wil to continue comes from an undivided place.</p>
<p> Lessons: Go an extra mile,it reflects on your results.</p>
<p>Plus One: I built my first portfolio on code pen <a href="https://codepen.io/twenties/full/MExJMY/">Here</a></p>
<h5> Day 15 - 22</h5>
<p>Task Review: The tasks are getting hard but so my confidence is growing steadily.I have become so used to wroting R code and I love it.For the first I feel comfortable.I am starting to appreciate the value of commitments,it not only gets you there but also makes you better</p>
<p>Challenges:Work is getting more demanding and I have to keep up.I find myself doing tasks just be fore bed and I even doze off sometimes.</p>
<h5>Day 22 -27</h5>
<p>Task review:What a week I must say.my worst so far!I am falling short on my time,work is pressing so hard but i have to up my game.Also I am so tired I need some sleep </p>
<p>Plus One:I featured on star developer of the week.I just felt it was too much since I am just learning but yass it was exciting.</p>
<p>Challenges:The commitment levels in the group have really gone low,I just feel bad its not as exciting as it used to be at the start.</p>
